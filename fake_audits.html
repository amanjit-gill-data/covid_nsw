    <h1>The NSW school ventilation audits were faked.</h1>
    <h2>By Amanjit Gill</h2>
    
    <h3>Part 1: What they did</h3>

    <p> In 2021, the NSW government released a 
        <a href = "https://www.schoolinfrastructure.nsw.gov.au/what-we-do/we-look-after-our-schools/audit-reports.html">ventilation audit report</a>
        for every public school in NSW.
    </p>
    <p>
        Its <a href = "https://www.schoolinfrastructure.nsw.gov.au/content/dam/infrastructure/general/documents/SINSW_Fact_Sheet_Ventilation_Audit.pdf">ventilation audit fact sheet</a>
        says:
    </p>
    <p class = "pic">
        <img src="web_resources/image1.png" alt="Screenshot of ventilation audit fact sheet">
    </p>
    <p>
        I've examined the audit reports, and here's what I've found.
    </p>
    <p>
        Firstly, every room has supposedly been audited and put into category A or B. The screenshot above, 
        as well as the one below, suggests that the rooms are categorised based on their ventilation 
        i.e. the audit happens first, and then the category is chosen. <b>This is important to note.</b>
    </p>
    <p class = "pic">
        <img src="web_resources/image2.png" alt="Screenshot of ventilation audit key">
    </p>
    <p>
        However, I've checked the audits of 50-60 schools, and observed that:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Not one teaching area is in Category B. They are <u>all</u> in Category A 
            i.e. every single classroom did well on the audit and has 'earned' an A.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Not one office/staff/meeting area is in Category A. They are <u>all</u> in Category B.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This is weird. How can it be that every single classroom has met the requirements for 
        Category A, and every single office area hasn't?
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway, it says in the key above that Category B spaces have a density limit of 1 person per 4 sqm. 
        No density limit is specified for classrooms. <b>This is important to note.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I decided to test out the relationship between <u>room size</u> and <u>capacity</u> (how many people 
        are allowed). I randomly chose five schools and did a linear regression for each 
        (found a best-fit line), using <u>only</u> Category A rooms. Here's just one example:
    </p>
    <p class = "pic">
        <img src="web_resources/image3.png" alt="Graph of capacity vs room size for Aberdeen PS">
    </p>
    <p>
        I got near-identical results for all five schools. They all have a coefficient of determination 
        of 1.0. This means that 100% of the variation in room <u>capacity</u> can be predicted from room 
        <u>size</u>. In other words, you don't need any other variables when guessing what the 
        room's capacity might be. Wow.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now for the Category B rooms. I divided the room size by 4 (the density limit stated in the 
        audit key above) and rounded down to be conservative. This gave me the <u>exact same capacity</u> 
        as the audit report for every single Category B room across the five schools. Again, this 
        means that if you know the room size, you can guess the capacity correctly every time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having obtained a perfect relationship for Category B, I revisited Category A. The regression 
        equation for each of the five schools varies just slightly, so I couldn't just choose one and 
        apply it to the other schools to guess their capacities. I wanted a perfect (or near-perfect) 
        relationship that I could apply to any school with great accuracy. Because the density limit 
        worked so well with Category B, I decided to start by randomly choosing a density limit 
        for Category A: 1 person per 2 sqm.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I tried this, I got close, but I was still a bit off. So I did an embarrassing amount of 
        trial and error before I obtained a relationship that worked for all five schools: To guess 
        the capacity, you reduce the room size by 7.5% (to be conservative I guess), divide it by 2 
        (my randomly selected density limit), then round down.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>This worked for 103 out of 106 rooms. For the 3 I got wrong, I was out by just 1.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        To summarise the two formulas:
    </p>
    <ul class = "important">
        <li>
            Category A: <b>capacity = floor(0.925 * size / 2)</b> &lt;-- the 0.925 reduces it by 7.5%
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Category B: <b>capacity = floor(size / 4)</b>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        (Note that 'floor' just means to round down.)
    </p>
    <p>
        To summarise how accurate these formulas are:
    </p>
    <ul class = "important">
        <li>
            The Category A formula is accurate for <b>97%</b> of the teaching spaces across the 
            five schools. It is never off by more than 1. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            The Category B formula is accurate for <b>100%</b> of the admin spaces across the 
            five schools.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            When all Category A and B rooms are combined, the accuracy overall is <b>98%</b>. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>For the Category A rooms, why isn't the formula 100% accurate?</b><br><br>
        Well, I think the DoE applied a few extra rounding rules:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            It seems that when the room capacity is very close to the next whole number up 
            (within about 0.1), they rounded <u>up</u> instead of down. For example, if it 
            was 24.93, then the room capacity would be 25, not 24. This holds true most of the time.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            For very large rooms, they rounded normally i.e. not just down. For example, 
            for a room capacity of 221.3, they would round <u>down</u>, but for a room capacity 
            of 221.7, they would round <u>up</u>. This holds true at least some of the time.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        I spent a little bit of time trying to perfect the formula, but it's already close to 
        100% accurate, and it's never off by more than 1, so it wasn't really worth the effort 
        for the amount of time it might have taken.
    </p>

    <h3>Part 2: Why does this even matter?</h3>

    <p>
        As noted earlier, the audit key implies that the categories were assigned <u>as a result of</u> 
        the audit. But this cannot be true, because every single classroom is Category A and every 
        single admin space is Category B. A real audit would have resulted in some mixing of categories, 
        but I did not observe this in any of the 50-60 audits I checked, suggesting that the categories 
        were assigned at the <u>beginning</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The capacity of any room is directly derivable from the room size. The coefficient of 
        determination (1.0) makes this irrefutable. A real audit would have resulted in some rooms 
        having their capacities increased or decreased due to inoperable windows, good HVAC systems, 
        etc. And this would have shown up on the above graph as data points scattered away from the 
        line, like this:
    </p>
    <p class = "pic">
        <img src="web_resources/image4.png" alt="Linear graph showing points scattered around it">
    </p>
    <p>
        If ventilation had any impact at all on the categorisation of the rooms, or their assigned 
        capacities, then the relationship between <u>room size</u> and <u>capacity</u> would not have 
        been perfectly linear, and the coefficient of determination would have been less than 1, 
        indicating the presence of other factors besides room size. <b>But nothing has been taken 
        into account except for room size.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        In publishing these pretend audits, the DoE has instilled a false sense of comfort in parents
        and staff, encouraging them to believe that their classrooms are safe. Without a <u>real</u>
        ventilation audit, involving CO2 monitoring and corrective measures like air purifiers, every 
        teacher, teaching assistant and student is in imminent danger. This is not a hyperbolic, 
        melodramatic, fearmongering or 'bed-wetting' statement; this is a statement of fact. No one can
        argue that the ventilation audits haven't been faked.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p>
        Overall, this is my theory about what really happened.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Once a classroom was known to have openable windows, it was designated as having 
            adequate ventilation, and thus assigned a density limit of 1 per 2 sqm.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            All admin spaces were assigned a density limit of 1 per 4 sqm, regardless of 
            ventilation status.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            For conservatism, a fudge factor of 7.5% was applied to each classroom before its capacity 
            was calculated.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            For nearly all rooms, the calculated capacity was rounded down for conservatism.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        If you've made it all the way to the end of this page, thank you. And... I'm sorry. This is an
        awful discovery, and it brings me no joy - only sorrow - to be informing you of it.
